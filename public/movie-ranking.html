<h1>The Most Impactful Movies Ever Made</h1>

<h2>My Top Three Favourites</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This movie touched my heart like no other. A journey through space
    and time, a powerful depiction of the love and emotions between a 
    father and his daughter transcending the barriers set by scientific
    theories, of black holes and beyond. 
</p>

<h3>Kimi No Na Wa</h3>
<p>The beautiful animation and unique storyline provided a
    pleasant visual and emotional experience. As different timelines 
    collide with a profound purpose, Taki and Mitsuha must strive 
    towards accomplishing the mission they didn't realise, they have 
    been entrusted with.   
</p>

<h3>San Andreas</h3>
<p>A fun and thrilling watch, this movie is about the power of family 
    and friends and what it takes to survive in the face of adversity.
    As earthquakes of magnitude 9 and above start hitting San Francisco,
    our main cast must find the courage to be resilient and overcome 
    the overwhelming obstacles.
